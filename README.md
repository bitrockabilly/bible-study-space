# bible-study-space

The Bible Study Space originated on the X platform. 
The founder spent a lot of time hosting and participating in many different spaces on X. 
People started mentioning that there should be a space to host open Bible study.
The founder, @FedUpVeteranUSA, took initiative and started a new profile to host the spaces.
@StudingGod was created and has a weekly space to read from the Bible and have listeners participate. 
Bible study is an essential part of growing as a Christian. Everyone has a unique way to hear and interperate God's word.
